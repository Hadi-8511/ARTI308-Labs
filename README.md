**Defining the Machine Learning Problem**

### Problem Type
Classification

### Dataset
Student Performance Dataset

### Target Variable
GradeClass

### Learning Objective
The model is expected to learn relationships between student-related features and the target variable in order to accurately classify students into different grade categories.

### Problem Description
The objective of this project is to classify students into performance categories based on their academic and behavioral features. The dataset includes information such as study time, number of absences, parental support, extracurricular activities, and GPA. The model aims to learn patterns that distinguish different student performance levels.
